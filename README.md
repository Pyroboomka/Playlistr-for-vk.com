Create playlists from feed posts

Installation:
1) Download folder
2) Add as a chrome unpacked extension
3) Make sure you have made at least one playlist, so vk.com generated your savePlaylistHash
  You can check it by typing cur.audioPage._data.createPlaylistHash in your audios page.
4) Extension will open new window once and will attempt to grab that hash and save it to localstorage.
5) Enjoy.
